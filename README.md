EMPYREANDAPP Impact Mining Program

Empowering Impact Through Decentralized Rewards

Welcome to the EMPYREANDAPP Impact Mining Program! This initiative is a core component of the Empyrean Humanitarian Foundation's decentralized ecosystem, designed to incentivize and reward users for their positive contributions and engagement within the platform. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency and fairness in recognizing and distributing value back to our community members.

Impact Mining transforms user actions into tangible rewards, fostering a self-sustaining circular economy where every interaction, from creating content to supporting humanitarian causes, earns you EMPY Tokens.

Key Features

*   Earn for Engagement: Get rewarded for a wide range of activities that strengthen our community and mission.
*   Transparent Rewards: All reward calculations and distributions are powered by smart contracts on the Polygon PoS blockchain, ensuring verifiable transparency.
*   Progressive Ranking System: Advance through distinct ranks by growing your influence and contributions, unlocking higher rewards.
*   Dedicated Reward Pool: A significant portion of the total EMPY token supply is allocated specifically for Impact Mining, distributed over a 12-year emission schedule.
*   Seamless Claiming: Easily view and claim your accumulated EMPY rewards directly to your wallet within the dApp.

How It Works

The Impact Mining program distributes EMPY tokens to users who perform valuable actions within the EMPYREANDAPP ecosystem. It operates in two main ways:

1.  Action-Based Rewards: Direct EMPY payouts for specific on-platform activities.
2.  Ranking Rewards: Milestone bonuses for users who achieve certain follower counts, recognizing their growing influence and community building.

### Earnable Actions (Examples)

Users can earn EMPY through various impactful actions, including but not limited to:

*   Verifying Crisis Reports: Contributing to the validation of urgent humanitarian crises.
*   Submitting SOS Requests: Successfully submitting verified requests for help.
*   Successful Marketplace Transactions: Acting as a buyer or seller in escrow-protected trades.
*   Content Creation: Posting to the main feed, publishing news articles, and uploading short-form "Reels."
*   Live Stream Hosting: Earning rewards for active participation during live streams.
*   Community Engagement: Receiving likes and comments on your content, and actively engaging with others' posts (liking, commenting, sharing, retweeting).
*   Referrals: Bringing new users into the Empyrean community.
*   Sharing Content: Spreading awareness about important posts and initiatives.
*   Retweeting Content: Amplifying the reach of valuable posts within the platform.

Tokenomics & Reward Distribution

The Impact Mining program is funded from a dedicated pool within the overall EMPY tokenomics.

| Allocation Category | Percentage of Total Supply | EMPY Amount (Total 150M) |
| :------------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Impact Mining & Community Rewards | 25% | 37,500,000 EMPY |
|   - Ranking Rewards Sub-Pool | 10% (of Impact Mining Pool) | 3,750,000 EMPY |
| Staking Pool | 10% | 15,000,000 EMPY |
| Grants & Impact Fund | 25% | 37,500,000 EMPY |
| Treasury & Liquidity | 15% | 22,500,000 EMPY |
| Partnerships & Ecosystem Growth | 15% | 22,500,000 EMPY |
| Team & Advisors | 10% | 15,000,000 EMPY |

The daily emission budget for general Impact Mining activities is carefully calculated to ensure sustainable distribution over an approximately 12-year period.

Smart Contracts

The core logic for Impact Mining rewards and distribution is managed by the following smart contracts on the Polygon PoS network:

| Contract Name | Purpose / Key Functions |
| :------------ | :---------------------- |
| EmpyreanToken | The ERC-20 token contract for EMPY. |
| EmpyDistributionV2 | Manages the distribution of general platform rewards. Key functions include: getUserClaimable, getUserMaxClaimNow, currentEmissionYear, remainingThisYear, activeMinWithdrawalTokens, claim, claimAll. |
| EmpyreanStaking | Handles rewards specifically for users staking their EMPY tokens. |
| NgoAndGrantRegistry | Records on-chain grant disbursements, providing transparency for humanitarian aid. |
| EmpyreanGrantVault | (Admin-facing) Manages and facilitates the distribution of grants to NGOs. |

Getting Started with Impact Mining

1.  Connect Your Wallet: Ensure your MetaMask wallet (or a compatible wallet) is connected to the EMPYREANDAPP platform. Your connected wallet address will be used to identify your rewards.
2.  Engage: Participate in various activities across the platform:
    *   Create and share posts.
    *   Upload Reels and news articles.
    *   Go live and host engaging streams.
    *   Report crises and submit SOS requests (if you're a verified contributor).
    *   Interact with other users' content (likes, comments, shares).
3.  Monitor Your Rewards: Navigate to the "My Wallet" section of the dApp. Here you will find:
    *   Your overall EMPY Token Balance.
    *   "Platform Rewards" section, displaying your Claimable Rewards, Max Claim Now, and details about the currentEmissionYear and remainingThisYear from the EmpyDistributionV2 contract.
    *   Your My Staked Balance and My Earned Rewards (from the Staking contract, if applicable).
4.  Claim Your EMPY:
    *   Click "Claim All Rewards" in the Platform Rewards section to collect all available EMPY from the EmpyDistributionV2 contract.
    *   For staking rewards, use the "Claim Now" button in the Staking section.

For Administrators

The Admin Panel includes a "Grant Vault Administration" section for managing on-chain grant distributions:

*   Connect MetaMask: An administrator must connect their MetaMask wallet to access these controls.
*   View Vault Balance: See the current EMPY balance held in the Grant Vault.
*   Distribute Equal Grants: Use the provided form to distribute an equal amount of EMPY to a list of specified NGO addresses for a particular project ID.
*   Distribute Variable Grants: Use the form to distribute varying amounts of EMPY to a list of NGO addresses.
*   Monitor Grant Events: A table displays recent OnChainGrantDisbursed events, offering a transparent record of all grants made through the vault.
